just some simple scripts for making .sh files instead of the whole chmod n sh stuff
and an apt installer for your crapz instead of sudo apt install blahh blahh ....
also a apt full updater thingy and a grub update rebooter 
and a custom lynis .prf file instead of the blahh default one 
run kaliscriptz.sh first to install the other ones
